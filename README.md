What is it?
===========

A Ruby library and command line tool for interfacing with [Dreamy's API][1]. The API itself is still very young so this is by no means a comprehensive library. Please fork and contribute!

Library Usage
=============

Dreamy requires a username (email or webID) and API key (available from your DH Panel) to make API requests.
